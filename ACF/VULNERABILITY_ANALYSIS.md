# Vulnerability Analysis & Mitigation Strategies (v2.0)

## Introduction

This document outlines common vulnerabilities in integrated physical-digital access control systems and proposes mitigation strategies, with a focus on the **Principle of Least Privilege**. An effective security posture requires anticipating potential attack vectors and implementing layered defenses.

### 1. Credential Theft / Compromise

* **Vulnerability:** An attacker gains possession of a user's physical credential (e.g., an RFID card) or digital credential (e.g., password).
* **Attack Scenario:** An attacker finds a lost keycard and uses it to gain entry to a restricted area. Or, an attacker uses a phishing email to steal an employee's password and access the corporate network.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** This is the most effective control. Require a secondary factor for sensitive access (e.g., Card + PIN, Password + OTP).
    * **Automated Anomaly Detection:** The system should flag impossible travel scenarios (as implemented in `analyzer.py`). If a card is used on-site while the user's digital account logs in from another country, both credentials should be temporarily disabled pending investigation.
    * **User Training:** Educate users on the importance of protecting their credentials and recognizing phishing attempts.

### 2. Privilege Escalation

* **Vulnerability:** A user with low-level access manages to gain permissions beyond what is authorized for their role.
* **Attack Scenario:** A low-level user discovers a flaw in the access control software that allows them to assign a higher access level to their own account, giving them access to the server room.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Enforce Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** This is a foundational defense. Grant permissions via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and conduct regular access reviews.
    * **Segregation of Duties:** Critical tasks should require more than one person. For example, one person can request an access change, but a different person must approve it.
    * **Privilege Probing Detection:** Monitor for patterns of failed access attempts against higher-level resources (as implemented in `analyzer.py`). Such patterns can be an early indicator of an insider threat or a compromised account attempting to escalate privileges.

### 3. Tailgating / Piggybacking

* **Vulnerability:** An unauthorized person follows an authorized person into a secure area.
* **Attack Scenario:** An attacker waits by a secure door and slips in behind an employee who has just badged in.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Physical Barriers:** Use turnstiles or mantraps that only allow one person to pass through per valid authentication.
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Train employees to never hold the door open for someone they don't know and to challenge and report unfamiliar individuals in secure areas.

### 4. Denial of Service (DoS)

* **Vulnerability:** An attacker overwhelms the access control system with requests, preventing legitimate users from gaining access.
* **Attack Scenario:** An attacker floods a network-connected door controller with traffic, causing it to crash and fail-safe to a locked state.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Rate Limiting:** The system should limit the number of authentication attempts from a single source in a given timeframe (as simulated for brute-force in `analyzer.py`).
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate access control system components on a separate, protected network segment.
